The structure of the presentation goes as follows: ⋅⋅1. Motivation ⋅⋅2. Usage ⋅⋅3. Implementation ⋅⋅4. Bonus Gestures ⋅⋅5. Conclusion.
The motivation behind my locomotion technique is to explore the hand tracking, since it is the first time I used it and as well as to explore how the locomotion technique can be achieved without any controller.
Next, there is a video of me using the locomotion technique, my plan is not to showcase it all, because I wouldn't like to spoil it and as well as spoil the capabilities of the gestures.
The implementation part is thoroughly covered in the previous section, so I am going to skip this section from explaining it here. The bonus gestures are something I have not talked about in these blogspot and I am going to give more details about them here.
First of all, we have the point gesture:

This gesture is the first extra gesture I recorded, it enables the user to fire a laser beam from the index finger and control it with his/her command, while moving the finger.
The second gesture:

This gesture is inspired from the game **super smash bros melee** where the last boss, is a giant hand and is able to fire laser, when doing that particular pose.

The only difference is that instead of firing lasers from each finger, we are firing a huge laser from the middle.
Last but not least, the last gesture:

This gesture create an explosion like particle effect which is cool for demonstation.
The conclusion of my presentation was the evaluation of the locomotion technique which was also mentioned in another blogpost.
