The structure of the presentation goes as follows: 1. Motivation 2. Usage 3. Implementation 4. Bonus Gestures 5. Conclusion.
The motivation behind my locomotion technique is to explore the hand tracking, since it is the first time I used it and as well as to explore how the locomotion technique can be achieved without any controller.
Next, there is a video of me using the locomotion technique, my plan is not to showcase it all, because I wouldn't like to spoil it and as well as spoil the capabilities of the gestures.
The implementation part is thoroughly covered in the previous section, so I am going to skip this section from explaining it here. The bonus gestures are something I have not talked about in these blogspot and I am going to give more details about them here.
First of all, we have the point gesture:

This gesture is the first extra gesture I recorded, it enables the user to fire a laser beam from the index finger and control it with his/her command, while moving the finger.
The second gesture:

This gesture is inspired from the game **super smash bros melee** where the last boss, is a giant hand and is able to fire laser, when doing that particular pose.
