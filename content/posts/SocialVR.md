Motivation
===============

This project started by thinking about the value of sharing
an experience. One can capture a proof of a spatial existence or a temporal state or a way to express their social
identities. One may ask then how will this be transferable to the virtual world where VR users can live similar
shareable experiences from game achievements to purely
visually fascinating scenes? To answer this question, I
decided to focus on a particular phenomenon that thrived
on social media: selfies. Selfie as a concept may look new
as it’s intrinsic to the emergence of social media, but I
can date back its origin to self-portraits but also to standard portraits. Self-portraits were based on this particular
idea of taking control of the take which makes the picture
an active action and a decision to create a content to be
shared. In portraits, I find a more elaborate “mise-enscène” which is an important aspect that we find also in
selfies.The selfie phenomenon is based on these two rules :
an active take in a special scene. I wanted our project to
be a way to transfer this mechanism to the virtual world.
By the immersive properties of VR, I can say that the
user is actually transported in space-and-probably time
and is living new experiences that are comparable to travelling and sightseeing and are at their core sharable to
everyone (VR-accustomed or not). This project was created with another two developer in context of creating something new in VR in order to contribute to a paper.

Describing the player and the scene
===============

First of all, I am not using the regular OVRCameraRig
but OVRPlayerController, this gives us the ability to move
more freely in the scene, since the controller joystick can be
used. The player contains a head and also two controllers
are shown. The left one is the controller that he/she can
interact with and the right one contains the two displays,
one for the in-game feed and the web camera feed.

When the user takes a photo we need to find a way to display it. I use cannons to throw the photos in front of the
player. These cannons follow the player, always face his
direction and they are placed in a circular diameter.When
a photo is taken, then they fire their photos to appear in
front of him/her. The main theme in our scene is giants
and they are scattered throughout the area. Our application contains three main scenes that the user can interact
with, I will explain them going from the simplest one to
the most complex one. The first scene is called the Lava
Giant. There is a lava area that contains a Lava giant, although he may seem dangerous he is only carefully watching the user as he/she passes by. There is no interaction
with this scene, just the giant is moving his body the way
in the direction that the user walks. In the second scene,
magic happens, literally. The second area of our game is
the complete opposite of a lava area, it is a snowy area.
In this area, there is a skull that has flaming eyes. When
the user touches the skull with the left controller then a
series of particle effects start to appear. After they finish
a second skull giant appears and he is constantly casting
a magic spell.

The last scene is staged in an oasis. When the user sees
the oasis he/she can make out two things: A sword with
energy that is drawn in it and two giants facing each other.
One of them is an earth golem or the protector of the oasis
and the other one is a demon.

We have to mention that all the models are humanoid
rigged models and they carry an animator component.
The main idea of the project is to merge two given selfies.

Merging feature
===============

One taken in the game and one taken in real life. As for the
result I chose to do this merging feature for both sides.
Meaning I will have at the end two types of results. First
one: The real background with the player’s avatar and the
second one: The background of the game with the actual
physical body of the player.

**Method used:**
I looked for ways to extract the user in real life and
the player in the game. Finally, I managed to narrow
it down to 2 methods. The first one consisted of using
deep learning techniques. It’s mainly the use of convolutional networks in order to extract the silhouette of the
user in real life. The second method was to use the built-in
function “GrabCut” of **OpenCVSharp** plus asset of unity.
After discussing the two methods I decided to go with
the “GrabCut”. I opted for this method, even with the
knowledge that the deep learning technique will perform
better, because the period dedicated to this project will
not allow me to completely assimilate this method and understand how to use it in Unity. Also, it will take much
longer to have a full working model ( gathering data set,
building the model and training it).
Now I am going to detail the full pipeline of my work
and possible enhancements. I will also explain some key
notions along the breakdown of the algorithm.

Calibration of the camera
===============

Since the final images depend on real life images and on
virtual elements, I need to have the two pictures taken
in each world perfectly aligned, ie, each virtual element
matches in size and position to its corresponding real element. This could be done by setting the virtual camera’s intrinsic and extrinsic parameters equal to those of
the webcam. For that, I mounted a webcam on one
controller via a 3d printed piece and created a Virtual
Camera ingame at the same position as the webcam by
calculating manually the offset in angles and in position.
I proceeded then to a camera calibration by inputting
FOV values from the webcam specs. This process can be
perfected by using chessboard calibration and making it
in a future version a dynamic calibration.

Extracting the elements in interest
===============

In this part, I am going to explain how I did extract
the user in real life and in game. For that I used the
built-in function Grabcut. Before heading to details, let’s
define the grabcut.

**Grabcut:** GrabCut is an image segmentation method
based on graph cuts. Starting with a user-specified bounding box around the object to be segmented, the algorithm
estimates the color distribution of the target object and
that of the background using a Gaussian mixture model.
The built-in function that I use will give the mask that
will define the object in interest(binary image).
Based on this definition, I have now to define an initial
rectangle. Assuming that both cameras, the virtual and
the physical one are perfectly aligned, we used a method
of the Camera’s class called **WorldToScreenPoint**. Using
it on the virtual camera, I can pinpoint the position of
any object on the screen.So we applied it to the head in
the game and with the alignment’s assumption I can say
that it will also coincide with the head in real life.
Right now I have the position of the head in pixels. Below, I showcase how I did define the initial rectangle
in a simple figure:

Merging the two selfies
===============

Using this rectangle I apply grabcut on both selfies.
That will give me two masks corresponding to the two silhouettes. Using these masks, I can cut the interesting
part in one picture and paste it on top of the other in the
same position (The alignment assumption is still valid).
The figure below highlights this process:
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petrosKon/Kontrazis/master/static/images/SocialVR%20-%207%20-%20How%20grabcut%20works.png)

Optimization of GrabCut method
===============

After trying out this method, I noticed that the resulting
masks are not as precise as I wanted. So I came up
with a way to enhance our results especially for the in
game selfie. As I know, GrabCut uses color distribution
in order to distinguish between the background and the
foreground. In order to use this technique at its fullest, I 
created a plane, having a uniform color, that will follow
the player in the game from behind. Using layers in Unity,
I made sure that this plane will be rendered only for
the selfie virtual camera so it will not affect the game’s
experience. For the selfie in real life, I tried to use a green
screen but the results were not as promising as expected.
I assumed that the initialization of the rectangle or the
lighting of the room are at fault.
Using this rectangle we apply grabcut on both selfies.
That will give me two masks corresponding to the two silhouettes. Using these masks, I can cut the interesting
part in one picture and paste it on top of the other in the
same position (The alignment assumption is still valid).
The figure below highlights this process:
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petrosKon/Kontrazis/master/static/images/SocialVR%20-%209%20-%20Final%20result.png)

Results of this method
===============

As you can see the result is not that realistic. In order
to make them more plausible, I thought about removing
the already existing element before pasting the new one
using the inpainting method. This last method is also a
built-in method in the **OpenCVSharp** asset. “Inpainting
is a conservation process where damaged, deteriorating,
or missing parts of an artwork are filled in to present a
complete image”. The built-in function for inpainting
requires an initial mask of the object to remove. So we
could use the masks defined by the grabCut algorithm. 

Conclusion
===============

I have described SelfieVR, a unity project where users
can explore different scenes and share their ingame experience with mixed selfies with elements from both the virtual
and the real worlds. The final prototype is an independent
oculus app but the ideal version should be a Unity SDK
that VR developers can import to their project to make
every VR experience shareable in the form of fun selfies.
SelfieVR can be used to capture a particular moment in
the virtual world, an emotion or a scene. These selfies can
then be shared on social media to engage other VR users
but also non VR users. This aims ultimately at making
the VR experience transcend its exotic nature and having everyone become accustomed to it in a way similar to
real life experiences such as travelling and meeting other
people.
