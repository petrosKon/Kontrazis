The main idea behind this project is the value that VR applications can offer for training purposes. We imagine that in the future, VR in combination with AR will be used in order to create training scenarios.
In our case we only use VR. The training scenario that we want the user to be accustomed to is the assembly and disassembly of an engine. For our example we are using this type of engine that is used mostly on
ships.
