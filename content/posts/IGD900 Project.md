Have you ever played VR and accidentally hit your hand over a wall? Have you ever played VR and managed to break something in your house?
As it turns out, you are not alone, it is not uncommon when using VR you may sometimes hit or break something. There is even a popular term on Youtube called **VR Fails** that yield way too many results and videos with a huge amount of views.
This introduction was to describe to you what we wanted to explore with this project. An application that would be able to cause **Harm** to the user.
But this harm is for a good reason, we needed to point out parameters that would make an application marked as "Harmful".
First of all, we discussed over different types of harm from physchological to physical harm and discussed different ideas for an application.
I would have two ideas, a horror game made in VR and with the use of jump scares it could induce harm to the user or a way to inflict physical harm. I went with the latter.
The whole application was developed purely in Unity and it was made for the Oculus Quest specifically.
