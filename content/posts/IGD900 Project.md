Have you ever played VR and accidentally hit your hand over a wall? Have you ever played VR and managed to break something in your house?
As it turns out, you are not alone, it is not uncommon when using VR you may sometimes hit or break something. There is even a popular term on Youtube called **VR Fails** that yield way too many results and videos with a huge amount of views.
This introduction was to describe to you what we wanted to explore with this project. An application that would be able to cause **Harm** to the user.
But this harm is for a good reason, we needed to point out parameters that would make an application marked as "Harmful".
First of all, we discussed over different types of harm from physchological to physical harm and discussed different ideas for an application.
I would have two ideas, a horror game made in VR and with the use of jump scares it could induce harm to the user or a way to inflict physical harm. I went with the latter.
The whole application was developed purely in Unity and it was made for the Oculus Quest specifically.
When I first started this application, it was a simple catch a ball game, where one user could throw balls to the player and the other would try to grab them.
It was developed and run in one machine, a pc or a laptop and the player in the laptop would see the user in VR and in real-life.

The picture above shows the result. The green circle is the depiction of the user's stationary boundary. The red circle is the depiction of the edges of the stationary boundary. The green arrow shows where the user is currently looking and the transparent green circle is the cursor with which the user in pc throws a ball.
