After creating many VR projects, I thought it was a good idea to move to AR, since it also fascinated me. My first idea for an AR project came from my favourite game the **Binding of Isaac** and especially platform games such as **Mario** since I am a big fan of them.
The main concept behind this project was to create a non linear platform game. For main components I used the cards from a deck.
Each card would serve as a platform with a level attached to it. When I was creating this project I utilized 4 cards.
