After creating many VR projects, I thought it was a good idea to move to AR, since it also fascinated me. My first idea for an AR project came from my favourite game the **Binding of Isaac** and especially platform games such as **Mario** since I am a big fan of them.
The main concept behind this project was to create a non linear platform game. For main components I used the cards from a deck.
Each card would serve as a platform with a level attached to it. When I was creating this project I utilized 4 cards: : 1) Ace of Spades 2) Two of Spades 3) Eight of Spades 4) Five of Hearts.

Each of these cards contained a different platform with different kind of interactions. First, I am going to start with the **Ace of Spades**.
In this card we summon the first stage and our hero, the ARcher. The hero starts without anything but
when he picks the arrow that is close to him, he will then gain a crossbow. Apart from the crossbow,
another button appears on the screen, this button when triggered, enables the player to shoot in the
direction that he is facing to. In the first level there are three things (two appear in this screenshot),
the spikes and the platform and a star pick up (not visible due to being VFX and have to be selected).
When the player touches the spikes he dies and after 2 seconds he will be respawned. To where he
respawns is dependent on which checkpoint he last touched. The checkpoints are the platforms where
we see our player standing in the above screenshot.
