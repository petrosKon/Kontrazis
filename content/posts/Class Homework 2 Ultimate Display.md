From the description of the ultimate display it fits in the top left of the reality-virtual continium  because it is a physical display with many different types of input.
The ultimate display is ultimately a digital screen but with the capabilities of exploring it using our senses.
The display does not provide any feedback to us apart from the visual one and we are the ones manipulating it.
