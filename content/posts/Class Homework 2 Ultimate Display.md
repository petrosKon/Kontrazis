The Ultimate display as described in this paper is a computer that is able to control the existence of matter. With that said, at first seems as more likely to the augmented reality since it can augment the environment and change it. On the other hand, one question is raised. If it is able to change and manipulate the reality itself, is the augmented reality collapses at the same point as reality?
Another thing to point out is that since it changes the and creating a new reality, is it also considered a virtual one? Which reality is the real one, the newly created or the previous one?
With these questions raised according to the ultimate display, I believe that the Ultimate display collases all the Reality-Virtuality Continuum of Milgram into a single point.
