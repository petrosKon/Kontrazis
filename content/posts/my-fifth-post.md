My main motivation behind this course is to explore locomotion techniques using hand tracking. I believe future headsets won't rely on controllers to move around as well as interact with the environment. 
The first method I propose is a non-linear approach to movement, that is shown in the following diagram.

The idea of this non-linear locomotion technique is that a user would grow up in an immense scale, then the avatar will be placed in the center of the track. A huge avatar will enable to player to see the whole track. With his/hers hand will draw a path along that track and the player stops drawing then he will revert back to normal size and follow the track that he/she already drew.
The reason I have not implemented this idea, is mainly because I thought it was off the time limit of the course. It would require rigorous implementation and the problems that may have arisen, would be greater than the other two implementations.

My second idea, is a gesture based locomotion techique. The user would do basic gestures and as a result, the VR camera will move accordingly.
