Before giving my locomotion technique for people to try it out, I tried it out myself with the parameters that we specified in the study.First, I tried it while I was standing and while seated on a revolving chair.
I found out that using the locomotion technique on a revolving chair was way easier and more fun because it felt part of a ride. When I found that out, I suggested that both my experiments will be done in that way.
First of all, I guided the users to practice it, for about two minutes. Both of them really like the fact that they could easily move to every direction in the stage, so in these two minutes they went through the whole stage and explored.
After that, I guided my participants to do as many rounds as possible in 10 minutes and be as fast as possible. What suprised me was that their average round time was very close for the two participants and it was really close to my time. I believe this is because the application was easy to learn and to control it.
Then we counted the average number of coins per round to the ratio of total coins. To be honest, my locomotion technique was hard to turn, so it was easy for players to miss the coins on the turns and as well as the last coins that were on the air. Since I tried and created the locomotion technique I realised there was no locomotion sickness.
To my suprised that happened to both of my participants, they felt no locomotion sickness, but I can't say if it was the way the technique was designed or the fact that they used it while seated on a chair, that made things easier.
The thing that also was expected is that participants didn't finish a lot of rounds, the first one only finishing 2 while the other 3. This was due to the fact that it became mundane after a while, because it was repetitive. Last but not least, the users had a lot of fun but did so while exploring the main stage and using the locomotion technique in addition with the lasers.
