Work
===============

During my time at **Magos** where I worked as a Unity developer. I created an API that is able to connect the hardware device a.k.a the **Motion Capturin glove** with a Vive tracker and make it possible to run in Unity 3d.

The next task that I needed to do was to connect our device accordingly so that it will control a Humanoid. Since one of the applications of this glove is to record finger movement.
Controlling a humanoid and make sure that our glove was able to move a rigged humanoid proved a very arduous task. The end result would be a humanoid that is able to correctly move inside the scene and move its fingers to 
change objects in the scene.
