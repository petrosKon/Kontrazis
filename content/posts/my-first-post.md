The hyper reality video presents the  distopian future in which Mixed reality is taking over our lives. Throughout the video it shows the different aspects of mixed reality and how they can potentially change the our lives.
Apart from these problems the video does not consider how the mixed reality is going to affect the interpersonal realtionships between people.
Even with cellphones, the interpersonal experience has changed, we seem more distant to more people and we judge them based on their social media accounts, sometimes their value is even depicted by them.
Hyper reality can cause even more problems in that domain, for example being at a palce and instead of interacting with people they are with, they are going to interact with their connections through the new kind of chatting.
Apart from that problem, people may be distanced more than ever, since in order to communicate and see each other they just need to connect to their virtual devices.
One of the first motives of virtual reality will be communication and as well as ways to enhance communication.
This enhancemnt could be done in multiplie ways like displaying videos showing awesome effect while talking to each other, using GIFS etc.
After having these kind of interactions and people getting used to them, the normal face to face interaction may feel mundane. 
In order to avoid that blink future, people must realise the importance of face to face communication. Except from just speaking, face to face communication is able to transfer feelings rather than just the need to talk to somebody. People must be able to realise the boundaries between them and impose rules on how much time they spend communicating through mixed reality equipment.

Apart from communication problem another issue that would arise with the invasion of mixed reality equipment is the impact on free space and even free time. A moment of mindfulness nowadays is crucial but it is very hard to achieve due to
the fast lifestyle as well as all the distractions that are there. This problem may be even more dominant with the existence of a mixed reality.
The series black mirror in the episode called "Fifty million merits" greatly depicts that problem.

The plot of this episode is that the protagonist is living in the future where the people would have to bike everyday in order to gain "merits", the currency of that time,
so that he can spend them on whatever he wants. He is trying to hoard money in order to get out of there to live a better life. In his room we can see the violation of privacy that he is trying to stay calm
after a long day biking, advertises popup in his room. In order to avoid them, he has two options: a) pay in order to skip them b) watch them. 
The important part is that the software also has eyetracking, so that when he doesn't  watch them the advertisment stops and require the user to continue  watching.

I believe this is a huge problems since ads are everywhere and they are already very invasive, but these kind of ads can be dangerous. Imagine having to look through the mixed reality glasses for 30 seconds in order to continue what you are doing.
This can be extented to our free time as well, when we want some relaxation or a little time off.
This is a serious problem of invasion in our lives but I believe there could be measures to counteract on it.
I believe people will adress this problem very seriously and as well as provide  laws so that companies wouldn't abuse this phenomenon.As well as I believe that there would be valuable software such as adblockers that the user can install and then these ads would diminish.
