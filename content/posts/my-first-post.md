The video presents the  distopian future in which Mixed reality is taking over our lives. Throughout the video it shows the different aspects of mixed reality and how they can potentially change the our lives.
Apart from these problems the video does not consider how the mixed reality is going to affect the interpersonal realtionships between people.
Even with cellphones, the interpersonal experience has changed, we seem more distant to more people and we judge them based on their social media accounts, sometimes their value is even depicted by them.
Hyper reality can cause even more problems in that domain, for example being at a palce and instead of interacting with people they are with, they are going to interact with their connections through the new kind of chatting.
Apart from that problem, people may be distanced more than ever, since in order to communicate and see each other they just need to connect to their virtual devices.
One of the first motives of virtual reality will be communication and as well as ways to enhance communication.
This enhancemnt could be done in multiplie ways like displaying videos showing awesome effect while talking to each other, using GIFS etc.
After having these kind of interactions and people getting used to them, the normal face to face interaction may feel mundane.
