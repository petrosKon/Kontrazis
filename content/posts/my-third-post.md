The point of the first lab is to create a roll a ball game. This example is compromised of different elements : 1) The player 2) The environment 3) Pickups - Different Objects.
First of all, we create our environment, a plane which is empty and it is located in the (0,0,0) position. This is the plane in which we are going to create our game.
We also assign a material to our plane so that it is not appear empty and appear a little colorful to the user playing it.
