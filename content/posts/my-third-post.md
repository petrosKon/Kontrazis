The point of the first lab is to create a roll a ball game. This example is compromised of different elements : 1) The player 2) The environment 3) Pickups - Different Objects.
First of all, we create our environment, a plane which is empty and it is located in the (0,0,0) position. This is the plane in which we are going to create our game.
We also assign a material to our plane so that it is not appear empty and appear a little colorful to the user playing it.

The next step is to create a player. The player in our situation is a sphere that is positioned in Y-Axis 0.5points above 0, this is why we want our player to just touch the plane.
We also assign a material to our player, in our case it is red.
