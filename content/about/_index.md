I have studied at the National University of Athens (NTUA) as a mechanical engineer. As it turned out, it wasn't what I really wanted to do, so I start by exploring programming. My first thesis was a programming one,
in Unity, where a player would have to cooperate with a robotic arm in order to simulate human-robot collaboration in a futuristic factory. After that project, I realised that programming was what I wanted to do. Firstly,
I did my internship in Ingredio, an application that scans the materials of products and determines if the product is healthy or not.
