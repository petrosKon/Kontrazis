I have studied at the National University of Athens (NTUA) as a mechanical engineer. As it turned out, it wasn't what I really wanted to do, so I start by exploring programming. My first thesis was a programming one,
in Unity, where a player would have to cooperate with a robotic arm in order to simulate human-robot collaboration in a futuristic factory. After that project, I realised that programming was what I wanted to do. Firstly,
I did my internship in Ingredio, an application that scans the materials of products and determines if the product is healthy or not.

In Ingredio I was an Android developer and my main tasks was to move from an **SQLite** database to **Firebase** online database. After working for 8 months in Ingredio I moved to **Content Management In Culture** and due to my skills,
I worked both as an Android and Unity developer.
